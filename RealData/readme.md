# README

This folder contains the code for generating the tables and figures presented in **Section: Applications to Electronic Health Records**.

## Data Preparation
**construct_KG.R**  
Estimates the **SVD-SPPMI embeddings** and computes the variance of the estimator.

## Tables and Figures
**RealData.R**  
Generates the following outputs:  
- **Table 2**: AUC of detecting known relation pairs with different methods  
- **Table 3**: Power of detecting known relation pairs  
- **Table 4**: Spearman rank correlation between scores and GPT ratings  
- **Figure 6**: Estimated low-rank PMI with the smallest p-values when quantifying their relationships with AD  
- **Figure 7**: t-SNE visualization of embeddings  

## Functions
**Evaluate_cos.R** and related helper files  
Provide the key functions used to evaluate cosine similarities, compute AUC, power, correlations, and generate plots.
